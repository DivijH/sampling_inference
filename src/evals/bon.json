    "question": "Let $T=10$. Ann spends 80 seconds climbing up a $T$ meter rope at a constant speed, and she spends 70 seconds climbing down the same rope at a constant speed (different from her upward speed). Ann begins climbing up and down the rope repeatedly, and she does not pause after climbing the length of the rope. After $T$ minutes, how many meters will Ann have climbed in either direction?",
    "solution": [
        "In 150 seconds (or 2.5 minutes), Ann climbs up and down the entire rope. Thus in $T$ minutes, she makes $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{T}{2.5}\\right\\rfloor$ round trips, and therefore climbs $2 T\\left\\lfloor\\frac{T}{2.5}\\right\\rfloor$ meters. After making all her round trips, there are $t=60\\left(T-2.5\\left\\lfloor\\frac{T}{2.5}\\right\\rfloor\\right)$ seconds remaining. If $t \\leq 80$, then the remaining distance climbed is $T \\cdot \\frac{t}{80}$ meters, and if $t>80$, then the distance climbed is $T+T \\cdot\\left(\\frac{t-80}{70}\\right)$ meters.

        "Reasoning:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Ann climbs up and down the rope in T minutes. We are given that Ann spends 80 seconds climbing up the rope and 70 seconds climbing down the rope.\n\nFirst, we need to find the speed of Ann while climbing up and down the rope. Since speed = distance / time, we can calculate the speed of Ann while climbing up and down as follows:\n\nSpeed_up = Distance / Time_up = T / 80\nSpeed_down = Distance / Time_down = T / 70\n\nSince Ann climbs up and down repeatedly, we need to find the total distance she climbs in either direction. To do this, we need to find the total time Ann spends climbing up and down the rope in T minutes.\n\nThere are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so T minutes is equal to 60T seconds. Since Ann spends 80 seconds climbing up and down, the total time she spends climbing up and down in T minutes is:\n\nTime_up_down = (T/60) * (80 + 70) = (T/60) * 150\n\nNow, we can calculate the total distance Ann climbs up and down:\n\nDistance_up = Speed_up * Time_up_down = (T/80) * (T/60) * 150\nDistance_down = Speed_down * Time_up_down = (T/70) * (T/60) * 150\n\nSince Ann climbs up and down repeatedly, the total distance she climbs in either direction is the sum of the distance she climbs up and the distance she climbs down:\n\nTotal_distance = Distance_up + Distance_down\n\nNow, we need to simplify the expression for Total_distance. We can factor out T from the numerator and denominator:\n\nTotal_distance = (T/80) * (T/60) * 150 + (T/70) * (T/60) * 150\n= (T^2/4800) * 150 + (T^2/4200) * 150\n= (T^2/32) * 150\n\nSince T = 10, we can substitute this value into the expression:\n\nTotal_distance = (10^2/32) * 150\n= (100/32) * 150\n= 3.125 * 150\n= 468.75 meters\n\nThe final answer is 468.75.",
        "Reasoning:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Ann climbs up and down the rope in T minutes. \n\nFirst, let's calculate Ann's speed while climbing up the rope. We know that she spends 80 seconds climbing up the rope. Since the length of the rope is T meters, her speed can be calculated as:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\nSpeed = T / 80\n\nNow, we know that Ann spends 70 seconds climbing down the rope. Her speed while climbing down the rope is the same as her speed while climbing up the rope, since she is moving at a constant speed. So, we can calculate her speed as:\n\nSpeed = T / 70\n\nSince Ann climbs up and down the rope repeatedly, we need to find the total distance she covers in T minutes. To do this, we need to find the number of times she climbs up and down the rope in T minutes.\n\nThere are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so there are 60 x T seconds in T minutes. Since Ann spends 80 seconds climbing up the rope, she will climb up the rope (60 x T) / 80 = 60T / 80 = 3T / 4 times in T minutes. Similarly, she will climb down the rope (60 x T) / 70 = 60T / 70 = 6T / 7 times in T minutes.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total distance Ann climbs up and down the rope. The total distance she climbs up is (3T / 4) x T = 3T^2 / 4 meters. The total distance she climbs down is (6T / 7) x T = 6T^2 / 7 meters.\n\nHowever, since Ann climbs up and down the rope repeatedly, the distance she climbs up is equal to the distance she climbs down. So, the total distance she climbs up and down the rope is the same. Therefore, we can calculate the total distance Ann climbs up and down the rope as:\n\nTotal Distance = 2 x (3T^2 / 4) = 3T^2 / 2 meters.\n\nThe final answer is 3T^2 / 2.",
        "Reasoning:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Ann climbs up and down the rope after T minutes. Since Ann spends 80 seconds climbing up the rope and 70 seconds climbing down, we need to convert the time from minutes to seconds to match the given time. \n\nThere are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so T minutes is equal to 60T seconds. We also know that T = 10 minutes, so 60T seconds is equal to 60 * 10 = 600 seconds.\n\nSince Ann climbs the rope at a constant speed, we can assume that the distance she climbs up the rope in 80 seconds is the same as the distance she climbs down the rope in 70 seconds. Let's call this distance 'd'. \n\nWe can write an equation for the distance Ann climbs up the rope in 80 seconds:\n\nd = (80/70) * T\n\nSince T = 10, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nd = (80/70) * 10\nd = (8/7) * 10\nd = 80/7\nd = 11.43 meters (approximately)\n\nNow that we know the distance Ann climbs up the rope in 80 seconds, we can find the total distance she climbs up the rope after 600 seconds. We can divide 600 seconds by 80 seconds to find the number of times Ann climbs up the rope:\n\n600 / 80 = 7.5\n\nSince Ann climbs up the rope 7.5 times, we can multiply the distance she climbs up the rope in 80 seconds by 7.5:\n\nTotal distance up = 7.5 * d\nTotal distance up = 7.5 * (80/7)\nTotal distance up = 7.5 * 11.43\nTotal distance up = 86.025 meters (approximately)\n\nNow, we can find the total distance Ann climbs down the rope after 600 seconds. We can divide 600 seconds by 70 seconds to find the number of times Ann climbs down the rope:\n\n600 / 70 = 8.57 (approximately)\n\nSince Ann climbs down the rope 8.57 times, we can multiply the distance she climbs down the rope in 70 seconds by 8.57:\n\nTotal distance down = 8.57 * d\nTotal distance down = 8.57 * (70/7)\nTotal distance down = 8.57 * 10\nTotal distance down = 85.7 meters (approximately)\n\nThe total distance Ann climbs is the sum of the distance she climbs up and down:\n\nTotal distance = Total distance up + Total distance down\nTotal distance = 86.025 + 85.7\nTotal distance = 171.725 meters (approximately)\n\nThe final answer is 171.725.",
        "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Ann climbs in both directions and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance Ann climbs in one upward and downward cycle. The distance climbed upward is $T = 10$ meters, and the time taken is 80 seconds. So, the upward speed is $10/80 = 1/8$ meters per second.\n\nSimilarly, the distance climbed downward is $T = 10$ meters, and the time taken is 70 seconds. So, the downward speed is $10/70 = 1/7$ meters per second.\n\nSince Ann repeats the cycle, the time taken for each cycle is the sum of the time taken for upward and downward climbs, which is $80 + 70 = 150$ seconds. We need to convert this time to minutes and then calculate the number of cycles completed in $T$ minutes.\n\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, so $T$ minutes is equal to $T/60$ cycles.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total distance climbed upward and downward.\n\nDistance climbed upward = (Number of cycles) * (Distance climbed upward in one cycle) = ($T/60$) * $T$\nDistance climbed downward = (Number of cycles) * (Distance climbed downward in one cycle) = ($T/60$) * $T$\n\nSince the distance climbed upward and downward are the same, we can simply multiply the distance climbed in one cycle by the number of cycles:\n\nTotal distance climbed = ($T/60$) * $T$ * 2\n\nNow, substitute $T=10$ into the equation:\n\nTotal distance climbed = ($10/60$) * $10$ * 2\n= ($1/6$) * $10$ * 2\n= $10/3$\n\nThe final answer is $10/3$.",
        "Reasoning:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find Ann's speed while climbing up and down the rope. Let's denote her upward speed as $v$ meters per second. Since she spends 80 seconds climbing up the rope, we can write the equation:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\nT = v * 80\n\nSince T = 10 meters, we can rewrite the equation as:\n10 = v * 80\nv = 10 / 80\nv = 1/8 meters per second\n\nNow that we know Ann's upward speed, we can find her downward speed. Since she spends 70 seconds climbing down the rope, we can write the equation:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\nT = v_down * 70\n\nSince the rope is the same, the distance is also the same. We can set up an equation using the fact that the distance is equal to the rope length (T = 10 meters):\n\n10 = v_down * 70\nv_down = 10 / 70\nv_down = 1/7 meters per second\n\nNow that we know Ann's upward and downward speeds, we can calculate the total distance she climbs in T minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we need to convert T minutes to seconds:\n\nT minutes = T seconds / 60\nT seconds = 10 * 60\nT seconds = 600 seconds\n\nSince Ann climbs up and down the rope repeatedly, we need to find the number of times she climbs the rope in 600 seconds. Let's denote this number as n. We can set up an equation using the fact that the total time is equal to the time spent climbing up and down:\n\nn * (time_up + time_down) = T seconds\nn * (80 + 70) = 600\nn * 150 = 600\nn = 600 / 150\nn = 4\n\nNow that we know the number of times Ann climbs the rope, we can calculate the total distance she climbs:\n\nTotal distance = (n * T) + (n * T)\nTotal distance = (4 * 10) + (4 * 10)\nTotal distance = 40 + 40\nTotal distance = 80 meters\n\nThe final answer is 80.",
        "Reasoning:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Ann climbs in either direction after T minutes.

Since she does this cycle T/60 times in T minutes, the total distance covered by her in either direction is (T/60) * 20 * 10 = 20T/3 meters.\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the total distance Ann will have climbed in either direction after T minutes.\n\nThe final answer is 20T/3.",
        "Reasoning:\n\nTo solve this problem, we first need to find Ann's speed while climbing up and down the rope. We know that she spends 80 seconds climbing up the rope and 70 seconds climbing down. \n\nLet's denote the length of the rope as $T$ meters. Since Ann climbs at a constant speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. \n\nFor the upward climb, we have: \nspeed_up = T / 80 \n\nFor the downward climb, we have: \nspeed_down = T / 70 \n\nSince Ann is climbing up and down repeatedly, we need to find the total distance she covers in both directions. \n\nWe can consider one complete cycle of climbing up and down as one unit. The time taken for one complete cycle is 80 + 70 = 150 seconds. \n\nIn one complete cycle, Ann covers the length of the rope (T) in the upward direction and the same length in the downward direction. \n\nSince Ann repeats this cycle after T minutes, we need to find out how many cycles she completes in T minutes. \n\nThere are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so there are 60 * T seconds in T minutes. \n\nWe can divide the total time by the time taken for one cycle to find the number of cycles: \nnumber_of_cycles = (60 * T) / 150 \n\nSince Ann covers the length of the rope in each cycle, the total distance covered in both directions is: \ntotal_distance = 2 * number_of_cycles * T \n\nNow, we can substitute the value of number_of_cycles into the equation: \ntotal_distance = 2 * ((60 * T) / 150) * T \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: \ntotal_distance = (2 * 60 * T) / 150 * T \n\ntotal_distance = (120 * T) / 150 * T \n\ntotal_distance = (2 * T) \n\nNow, we know that T = 10 meters.

        "Reasoning:\n\nTo solve this problem, we first need to find Ann's speed while climbing up and down the rope. Let's denote her upward speed as 'u' and downward speed as 'd'. We know that she spends 80 seconds climbing up the rope and 70 seconds climbing down, so we can set up the following equations:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nFor upward climb: 80 = T / u\nFor downward climb: 70 = T / d\n\nWe are given that T = 10 meters. Substituting the value of T in both equations, we get:\n\n80 = 10 / u => u = 10 / 80 => u = 1/8\n70 = 10 / d => d = 10 / 70 => d = 1/7\n\nNow that we have the speeds, we can calculate the distance Ann climbs in one upward and downward cycle. Since distance = speed * time, the distance Ann climbs upward in one cycle is:\n\nDistance upward = u * 80 = (1/8) * 80 = 10 meters\n\nSimilarly, the distance Ann climbs downward in one cycle is:\n\nDistance downward = d * 70 = (1/7) * 70 = 10 meters\n\nSince Ann climbs up and down repeatedly, the total distance she climbs in one cycle is:\n\nTotal distance in one cycle = Distance upward + Distance downward = 10 + 10 = 20 meters\n\nNow, we need to find the total distance Ann climbs in T minutes. Since T minutes = T * 60 seconds, we need to calculate the number of cycles Ann completes in T minutes.\n\nThe time taken by Ann to complete one cycle is 80 + 70 = 150 seconds. Therefore, the number of cycles she completes in T minutes is:\n\nNumber of cycles = (T * 60) / 150\n\nNow, we can calculate the total distance Ann climbs in T minutes by multiplying the number of cycles by the total distance in one cycle:\n\nTotal distance = Number of cycles * Total distance in one cycle\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nTotal distance = ((T * 60) / 150) * 20\n\nSince T = 10 minutes, we can substitute the value of T:\n\nTotal distance = ((10 * 60) / 150) * 20\n\nTotal distance = (600 / 150) * 20\nTotal distance = 4 * 20\nTotal distance = 80 meters\n\nThe final answer is 80.",
        "Reasoning:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Ann climbs in both directions after T minutes. We are given that Ann spends 80 seconds climbing up a T meter rope and 70 seconds climbing down the same rope. \n\nFirst, we need to find Ann's speed while climbing up and down the rope. We know that speed = distance / time. So, her speed while climbing up is T / 80 and her speed while climbing down is T / 70.\n\nSince Ann climbs up and down repeatedly, we need to find the total time she spends climbing in both directions. We are given that she spends T minutes climbing, which is equal to 60T seconds. The time she spends climbing up is 80 * (60T / 60) = 80T seconds, and the time she spends climbing down is 70 * (60T / 60) = 70T seconds.\n\nNow, we can find the total distance Ann climbs in both directions by multiplying her speed by the time she spends climbing. The total distance she climbs up is (T / 80) * 80T = T meters, and the total distance she climbs down is (T / 70) * 70T = T meters.\n\nHowever, since Ann climbs up and down repeatedly, the total distance she climbs up and down is not simply 2T meters. We need to consider the fact that she is climbing up and down repeatedly. Let's analyze this by breaking down the problem into smaller parts.\n\nLet's assume Ann climbs the rope 'n' times in the upward direction and'm' times in the downward direction. Then, the total distance she climbs up is nT, and the total distance she climbs down is mT. Since Ann spends the same amount of time climbing up and down, we can set up the equation: 80n = 70m.\n\nWe also know that the total time Ann spends climbing is 60T seconds. This is equal to the sum of the time she spends climbing up and the time she spends climbing down: 80n + 70m = 60T.\n\nNow, we need to find the values of 'n' and'm' that satisfy these two equations. However, we can simplify the problem by noticing that we don't actually need to find 'n' and'm'. We can simply use the fact that the total distance Ann climbs up is equal to the total distance she climbs down, and that the total time she spends climbing is T minutes.\n\nSince the total distance Ann climbs up is equal to the total distance she climbs down, we can set up the equation: nT = mT. This implies that n = m.\n\nNow, we can substitute n = m into the equation 80n = 70m. We get 80m = 70m, which is true for any value of'm'. This means that'm' can be any value, and 'n' will be equal to'm'.\n\nSince we know that the total time Ann spends climbing is 60T seconds, and she spends 80 seconds climbing up and 70 seconds climbing down, we can set up the equation: 80n + 70m = 60T. Substituting n = m, we get 80m + 70m = 60T.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get 150m = 60T. Dividing both sides by 150, we get m = (60/150)T = (2/5)T.\n\nNow, we can find the total distance Ann climbs in both directions by multiplying the distance she climbs in one direction by 2. The total distance she climbs up is 2nT = 2mT = (2/5) * 2 * T = (4/5)T meters.\n\nThe final answer is (4/5)*10 = 8.",
        "Reasoning:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Ann climbs up and down the rope in T minutes. Since Ann spends 80 seconds climbing up and 70 seconds climbing down, we need to find the total time she spends climbing in T minutes.\n\nFirst, we need to convert T minutes to seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can multiply T by 60 to get the total number of seconds.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of times Ann climbs up and down the rope in T minutes. Since Ann spends 80 seconds climbing up and 70 seconds climbing down, we can divide the total number of seconds by the time it takes her to climb up or down to find the number of cycles.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that Ann does not pause after climbing the length of the rope, so she will climb up and down the same rope multiple times. To account for this, we need to divide the total number of seconds by the time it takes her to climb up or down, and then multiply by 2 to get the total number of cycles.\n\nLet's denote the number of cycles as 'n'. Since Ann spends 80 seconds climbing up and 70 seconds climbing down, we can set up the equation:\n\n80n + 70n = 60T\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n150n = 60T\n\nNow, divide both sides by 150:\n\nn = (60/150)T\n\nSimplify:\n\nn = (2/5)T\n\nNow that we have the number of cycles, we can calculate the total distance Ann climbs up and down the rope. Since Ann climbs up the rope for 80 seconds and down the rope for 70 seconds, the total distance she climbs in one cycle is:\n\n80 + 70 = 150 meters\n\nSince Ann makes 'n' cycles, the total distance she climbs in either direction is:\n\nn * 150 = ((2/5)T) * 150\n\nSimplify:\n\nn * 150 = (2/5) * 150T\n\nn * 150 = 60T\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total distance Ann climbs in T minutes. Since we have the total number of cycles, we can multiply the distance per cycle by the number of cycles:\n\n150n = 60T\n\nNow, substitute n = (2/5)T:\n\n150 * (2/5)T = 60T\n\nSimplify:\n\n60T = 60T\n\nThis equation is true for any value of T, but we still need to find the total distance Ann climbs in T minutes. Since we know that Ann makes 'n' cycles, and the distance per cycle is 150 meters, we can calculate the total distance as:\n\nTotal distance = n * 150\n\nSubstitute n = (2/5)T:\n\nTotal distance = ((2/5)T) * 150\n\nSimplify:\n\nTotal distance = (2/5) * 150T\n\nTotal distance = 60T\n\nThe final answer is 60T."
