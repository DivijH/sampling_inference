    "question": "A cylinder with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume 1 and total surface area 12. Compute $\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{h}$.",
    "solution": [
        "Since $\\pi r^{2} h=1$, we have $h=\\frac{1}{\\pi r^{2}}$ and $\\pi r^{2}=\\frac{1}{h}$. Consequently,\n\n$$\n2 \\pi r h+2 \\pi r^{2}=12 \\Rightarrow(2 \\pi r)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi r^{2}}\\right)+2\\left(\\frac{1}{h}\\right)=12 \\Rightarrow \\frac{2}{r}+\\frac{2}{h}=12 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{h}=\\mathbf{6}\n$$",
        "The total surface area is $2 \\pi r h+2 \\pi r^{2}=12$ and the volume is $\\pi r^{2} h=1$. Dividing, we obtain $\\frac{12}{1}=\\frac{2 \\pi r h+2 \\pi r^{2}}{\\pi r^{2} h}=\\frac{2}{r}+\\frac{2}{h}$, thus $\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{h}=\\frac{12}{2}=\\mathbf{6}$."
