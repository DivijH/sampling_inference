        "**Reasoning:**\n\n1. Use the constraint on the total surface area to express $h$ in terms of $r$: We start by writing the equation for the total surface area of the cylinder: $2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh = 12$. We can solve for $h$ in terms of $r$: $h = \\frac{12 - 2\\pi r^2}{2\\pi r}$.\n2. Substitute the expression for $h$ into the equation for volume: The volume of the cylinder is given by $\\pi r^2h$. We can substitute the expression for $h$ into this equation to get: $\\pi r^2 \\left(\\frac{12 - 2\\pi r^2}{2\\pi r}\\right)$.\n3. Simplify the equation: Simplifying the equation, we get: $\\frac{12r - 2\\pi r^3}{2}$.\n4. Set the volume equal to 1: We know that the volume of the cylinder is 1, so we can set the equation equal to 1: $\\frac{12r - 2\\pi r^3}{2} = 1$.\n5. Solve for $r$: We can solve for $r$ by first multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: $12r - 2\\pi r^3 = 2$. Then, we can rearrange the equation to get a cubic equation in terms of $r$: $2\\pi r^3 - 12r + 2 = 0$.\n6. Use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the reciprocals of the roots: Since we are asked to find $\\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{1}{h}$, we can use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of the cubic equation. Let the roots of the equation be $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$. Then, we know that $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 0$, since the coefficient of the $r^2$ term is 0. We also know that $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = -\\frac{12}{2\\pi} = -\\frac{6}{\\pi}$, since the coefficient of the $r$ term is $-\\frac{12}{2\\pi}$. Finally, we know that $r_1r_2r_3 = \\frac{2}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{\\pi}$, since the constant term is 2. Using Vieta's formulas, we can write: $\\frac{1}{r_1} + \\frac{1}{r_2} + \\frac{1}{r_3} = \\frac{r_2r_3 + r_1r_3 + r_1r_2}{r_1r_2r_3} = \\frac{-\\frac{6}{\\pi}}{\\frac{1}{\\pi}} = -6$.\n\n**The final answer is -6.**",
